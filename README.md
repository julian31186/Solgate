# Certificate Machine

### ** ðŸ“œ Welcome ðŸ“œ**
## **Introduction**

A Solana project to help Organisations and Education institutions alike to emit their certificates as NTFs on Solana Blockchain very easily and cheap.

## **Value Proposition **

Organisation, be it Educational or otherwise has turned to using NFTs and Blockchain technology to furnish important documents like Certificates and Degrees. However, in the current landscape, chains like Ethereum or Polygon, makes the whole experience both costly and hence, in countries like India, the whole thing becomes economically not viable. Also, in cheaper chains like Solana, there exists no one-to-one easy to use NFT minting solution.

## **Purpose **

Our objective since the beginning has been to attract people from outside Solana. To use the blockchain, for itâ€™s obvious advantages, namely the speed, the volume of transactions that could be processed and the low cost for each transactions.
Coupling all of those benefits we wanted to create a project which would fit into the ecosystem nicely and at the same time provide people something easy to use interface for minting and sending NFTs to people. Especially the educational institutions and Organisations in general.
